	MultiMarkdown - lightweight markup processor

	@brief MultiMarkdown library header

	libMultiMarkdown.h provides the key commands to convert raw MultiMarkdown
	text into a desired export format.

	For most simple uses, the main API commands provided here are sufficient.
	For more complex scenarios, however, you may need to handle file
	transclusion which requires knowledge about the location of the source
	file in order to appropriately handle relative links.  In this case, you
	may benefit from examining multimarkdown.c.
